# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive recipe management capabilities to the restaurant system, allowing staff to create, read, update, and delete recipes for both food and drinks. The system will support detailed recipe information including ingredients, preparation steps, nutritional data, and categorization to help restaurant operations manage their menu items effectively.

## Requirements

5. WHEN a recipe ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a restaurant manager, I want to update existing recipes, so that I can modify ingredients, adjust preparation steps, or correct recipe information as needed.

2. WHEN a user updates ingredients THEN the system SHALL support adding, removing, or modifying individual ingredients
3. WHEN a user updates preparation steps THEN the system SHALL support adding, removing, or reordering steps
4. WHEN a recipe is updated THEN the system SHALL timestamp the modification date
5. WHEN updating a non-existent recipe THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
6. WHEN invalid data is provided THEN the system SHALL return validation errors without modifying the recipe

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a restaurant manager, I want to delete recipes that are no longer used, so that I can keep the recipe database clean and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user deletes a recipe by ID THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the recipe and all associated data
2. WHEN deleting a non-existent recipe THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
3. WHEN a recipe is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation message
4. WHEN a recipe deletion fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the recipe API to handle errors gracefully, so that the application remains stable and provides clear feedback to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid JSON is sent in requests THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with parsing details
2. WHEN required authentication is missing THEN the system SHALL return a 401 error
3. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL return a 500 error with generic message
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 422 error with specific field validation messages
5. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error details and return a generic 500 error to the client

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the recipe data to be properly structured and validated, so that the system maintains data integrity and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recipe data is stored THEN the system SHALL enforce required fields: name, category, and at least one ingredient
2. WHEN ingredient quantities are provided THEN the system SHALL validate that quantities are positive numbers
3. WHEN preparation times are provided THEN the system SHALL validate that times are positive integers (in minutes)
