# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive recipe management capabilities to the restaurant system, allowing staff to create, read, update, and delete recipes for both food and drinks. The system will support detailed recipe information including ingredients, preparation steps, nutritional data, and categorization to help restaurant operations manage their menu items effectively.

## Requirements

3. WHEN a user selects an ingredient THEN the system SHALL store the product reference, quantity, unit of measurement, and optional notes for each ingredient
4. WHEN a user adds preparation steps THEN the system SHALL store step-by-step instructions with order sequence and optional timing information
5. WHEN a recipe is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique identifier and timestamp the creation date
6. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with specific field requirements
7. WHEN a user attempts to add an ingredient that doesn't exist as a product THEN the system SHALL prevent the addition and display available products for selection

### Requirement 2

5. WHEN a recipe ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a restaurant manager, I want to update existing recipes, so that I can modify ingredients, adjust preparation steps, or correct recipe information as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates a recipe THEN the system SHALL allow modification of all recipe fields except the unique identifier
2. WHEN a user updates ingredients THEN the system SHALL support adding, removing, or modifying individual ingredients
3. WHEN a user updates preparation steps THEN the system SHALL support adding, removing, or reordering steps
4. WHEN a recipe is updated THEN the system SHALL timestamp the modification date
5. WHEN updating a non-existent recipe THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
6. WHEN invalid data is provided THEN the system SHALL return validation errors without modifying the recipe

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a restaurant manager, I want to delete recipes that are no longer used, so that I can keep the recipe database clean and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user deletes a recipe by ID THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the recipe and all associated data
2. WHEN deleting a non-existent recipe THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
3. WHEN a recipe is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation message
4. WHEN a recipe deletion fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

2. WHEN required authentication is missing THEN the system SHALL return a 401 error
3. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL return a 500 error with generic message
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 422 error with specific field validation messages
5. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error details and return a generic 500 error to the client

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the recipe data to be properly structured and validated, so that the system maintains data integrity and consistency.

6. WHEN preparation steps are added THEN the system SHALL ensure each step has non-empty instruction text

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a chef using the frontend interface, I want to create recipes with ingredients selected from the inventory database, so that I can ensure accurate cost tracking and inventory management integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria
