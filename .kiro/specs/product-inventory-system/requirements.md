# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a product inventory management system for restaurants. The system will track product quantities, link ingredients to recipes, automatically update inventory when sales occur, and provide alerts for low stock situations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a restaurant manager, I want to manage product inventory, so that I can track all products and their quantities in my restaurant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the inventory module THEN the system SHALL display a list of all products with their current quantities
2. WHEN a user adds a new product THEN the system SHALL store the product name, description, unit of measure, and current quantity
3. WHEN a user updates product information THEN the system SHALL save the changes and reflect them immediately in the inventory display

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a restaurant manager, I want to link recipe ingredients to inventory products, so that I can track which products are used in each recipe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or edits a recipe THEN the system SHALL allow linking recipe ingredients to existing inventory products
2. WHEN an ingredient is linked to a product THEN the system SHALL store the relationship between the recipe ingredient and inventory product
3. WHEN a recipe is viewed THEN the system SHALL display which inventory products are associated with each ingredient

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a restaurant manager, I want inventory quantities to automatically decrease when sales occur, so that I maintain accurate stock levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sale is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce the quantity of associated inventory products
2. WHEN a recipe-based item is sold THEN the system SHALL decrease quantities for all linked ingredient products
3. WHEN inventory is updated due to sales THEN the system SHALL log the transaction with timestamp and quantity changed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a restaurant manager, I want to receive alerts for products running low on stock, so that I can reorder before running out.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product quantity falls below 10 units THEN the system SHALL generate a low stock alert
2. WHEN low stock alerts exist THEN the system SHALL display them in a dedicated alerts section
3. WHEN a product is restocked above the threshold THEN the system SHALL automatically clear the low stock alert

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a restaurant manager, I want to see out-of-stock alerts prominently on my dashboard, so that I can immediately address critical inventory issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product quantity reaches zero THEN the system SHALL display an out-of-stock banner on the dashboard
2. WHEN multiple products are out of stock THEN the system SHALL show all out-of-stock products in the banner
3. WHEN out-of-stock products are restocked THEN the system SHALL remove them from the dashboard banner
